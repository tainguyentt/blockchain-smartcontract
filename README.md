# Hello Ethereum Smart Contract
A simple smart contract of Ethereum blockchain following the [guide](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract)

## Steps
- Connect to Ethereum network using Alchemy - a blockchain developer platform and API that allows us to communicate with the Ethereum chain without having to run our own nodes
- Create an Ethereum account using Metamask
- Create a project using Hardhat - a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers when building smart contracts and dApps locally before deploying to the live chain
- Connect Metamask and Alchemy and update hardhat.config.js file
- Install Ethers.js - a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to Ethereum by wrapping standard JSON-RPC methods with more user friendly methods


# Project Structure
```
- contracts/ smart contract code files
- scripts/ scripts to deploy and interact with our contract
```
